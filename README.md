# KodeCamp-7
Hey there

👏🏾 SETUP AND START
- To set up the app, ensure you install all packages
- Add your own RAPIDAPIKEY and MONGO_URI to the .env folder
- You can get the APIKEY from the website https://rapidapi.com/ipfind/api/find-any-ip-address-or-domain-location-world-wide/ after subscribing to it
- Run the command npm start on your console from the base folder 'KODE-CAMP-LEVEL7'
- Wait for the database to connect before you start testing endpoints

🛠 TOOLS USED
- I used the express generator to generate the boilerplate express server
- nodemon to restart the server
- morgan for logging requests
- axios to fetch data from my external api
- mongoose to connect to my mongoDB and to make Schemas
- dotenv to hide my private keys from being pushed with the repo

💫 AREAS FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION
- The function to get distance from longitude and latitude is a bit complex

❌ AREAS I COULDN'T FINISH
- I planned on making the db connect before the server starts listening on the port but i'm not used to the syntax in the bin.www file so i'd read up on it

ANYTHING ELSE TO KNOW ABOUT
- NONE REALLY, Enjoy
